   Language is at the core of human communication, and for centuries, we've endeavored to unravel how it is intricately woven into 
our cognitive processes. Today, we are on a quest to advance further by introducing computers to the realm of human language 
through Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is an artificial intelligence branch dedicated to harnessing machine learning
techniques for a wide range of language-related tasks.
    In recent years, NLP has witnessed a remarkable evolution with the emergence of transformative techniques such as transformers, 
the encoder-decoder framework, and the attention mechanism. These innovations have reshaped the landscape of NLP. To gain a deep 
understanding of these developments, one of the most valuable resources is the book on NLP with transformers, which we are 
summarizing in this series of articles.
